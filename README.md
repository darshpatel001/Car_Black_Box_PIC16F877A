# Car Black Box System Using PIC16F877A

## Overview

The Car Black Box System is an embedded application developed using the PIC16F877A microcontroller to monitor, record, and manage vehicle events.

The system continuously logs vehicle events along with speed and timestamp information. Logged data is stored in external EEPROM and can be viewed, downloaded, or managed through a password-protected user interface.

This project simulates the functionality of an automotive black box used in modern vehicles for diagnostics, event tracking, and accident investigation.

## Working Principle

### Dashboard Mode

The dashboard continuously displays:

* Current Time
* Vehicle Event
* Current Speed

Example:

```text
TIME      EV SP
12:45:10  G2 45
```

---

### Event Logging

Whenever an event occurs:

* Collision
* Reverse Gear
* Gear Change

The system records:

```text
Time + Event + Speed
```

Example:

```text
124510G245
```

Stored inside external EEPROM.

---

### Login System

Access to logs is password protected.

Default Password:

```text
0000
```

Features:

* 3 Login Attempts
* User Blocking Mechanism
* Password Change Support

---

### Main Menu

```text
1. View Log
2. Clear Log
3. Download Log
4. Set Time
5. Change Password
```
